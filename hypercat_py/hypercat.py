## Usage:
##    Create a hypercat object
##    Optionally, add metadata to it with .addRelation()
##    Optionally, add items to the catalogue with .addItem()
##        (an item is either a hypercat or a resource)
##    Output it as JSON, either minimally or prettyprinted
##
## Example:
##    # Create a catalogue
##    h = Hypercat("CatalogueContainingOneCatalogueAndOneResource")
##    # Create a second catalogue, and add it as a child of the first
##    h2 = Hypercat("ChildCatalogue")
##    h.addItem(h2, "http://FIXMEcat")
##    # Create a resource, and add it as another child of the first catalogue
##    r = resource("resource1", "application/vnd.tsbiot.sensordata+json")
##    h.addItem(r, "http://FIXMEresource")
##    # Print the raw JSON of the catalogue, and then with human-friendly formatting
##    print h.asJSON()
##    print h.prettyprint()
##
## See unit tests for more examples

# TODO:
#   4.3.3 Says that it is optional to use isContentType to tag each member of items[]
#   However we treat it here as mandatory.
#
#
# HOW IT WORKS
# According to the spec, each Catalogue has a (human-readable) description and a list of metadata about it.
# It also contains a list of "items", and each item has an HREF and a list of metadata about it.
# An item can be any kind of resource, including another catalogue.
#
# So conceptually, catalogues can have many levels of hierarchy (i.e. a catalogue can contain a catalogue which contains a catalogue and so on).
# (Catalogues don't just have to be trees either, they can be graphs, contain loops etc.)
# And clients of this module will often want to declare full catalogue structures several levels deep, i.e. build their entire hierarchy in one go.
#
# But according to the 1.0 spec only one level of Catalogue can be output at a time,
# i.e. getting a catalogue will declare its child catalogues, but not its grand-children
# (to see the grand-children, you'd have to get the child catalogue)
#
# A further complication is some asymmetry in how attributes are declared
# when a catalogue is the parent, vs. when it is the child
#
# To deal with this, within this module we maintain a universal base class for every hypercat object.
# Then during output, we ignore grand-children, and modify attributes as necessary.
